# SmartShelf interface

## Source and scope

Adapted from [SmartShelf Complete UI/UX](https://www.figma.com/design/08Fxp25B9QPT0iFPfSamGN/SmartShelf-Complete-UI-UX?node-id=5-5). The saved screen exports and handoff in `output/design/` were used with Alaa's approval because the live Figma connector was rate-limited. The initial English adaptation was approved; Alaa subsequently authorized the Day 11 English/Arabic language foundation and RTL layout. This is a responsive adaptation, not a claim of pixel-identical Arabic screens.

The shared shell, sign-in, owner pharmacy/account/subscription screens, and medicine/batch screens use this design. Dashboard/profile/duty screens now reuse these tokens and responsive surfaces, with EN/AR labels and feedback. Public search/directory reuse the same tokens, responsive filters and pharmacy cards. Light/Dark/System is connected across the application; see the 7 November integration update below. Shared, sign-in, owner/inventory and pharmacist EN/AR translations and direction are implemented. Public search/directory labels are also translated through the shared provider.

## Shared foundations

- Base theme variables live in `apps/web/src/styles.css`, with the cream/forest refinement layer in `apps/web/src/refresh.css`: warm cream background, off-white surfaces, deep green text/sidebar, green actions and pale mint active navigation. Gold remains a restrained secondary accent.
- Cairo is served locally from `apps/web/public/fonts/`; its SIL Open Font License is included there. The exports use Cairo as their Arabic font fallback. No external font request is required.
- Controls use a 12px radius and at least 44px height; panels use a 20px radius. Spacing follows an 8px base.
- Use textual status labels alongside color. Muted/error text is darker than the source swatches for readability.
- Do not invent counts, accounts, currency symbols or successful API responses to match a prototype. Keep development samples explicitly labelled.

## Layout and components

`AppShell` owns role navigation, brand, sidebar, mobile menu, main landmark, skip link and footer. Keep feature behavior inside feature components. Direct English/العربية and sun/moon switches use LanguageProvider and ThemeProvider; there are no preference dropdowns or popovers.

Desktop workspaces have a 248px sidebar on the left in English and right in Arabic. Navigation collapses behind Menu at 760px; Escape closes it and restores toggle focus. Lists adapt to labelled cards by 1050px, with intermediate column adjustments at 1180px. Forms stack on narrow screens. Login uses two desktop columns and puts the form first on mobile.

Owner styles live in `features/owner/owner.css`; inventory styles live in `features/inventory/inventory.css`. Reuse global tokens and shared control styles rather than creating a separate palette for new screens.

## Behavior and verification

Preserve loading/empty/error/success states, session handling, subscription restrictions, draft preservation and immutable batch fields. Real routes never use preview fixtures as an API fallback. Both preview routes remain development-only.

Browser checks cover 320/390/768/1280/1440px layouts, local font loading, horizontal overflow, mobile menu, skip link and form layouts. Existing owner/inventory/session regression scripts cover functional behavior with fixtures and simulated API responses. These checks do not prove real authentication or PostgreSQL integration.

Language implementation and extension guidance is in `docs/LANGUAGE.md`. Preserve explicit LTR identifiers and medicine names inside the RTL layout.

## Cream and forest refinement - 6 November 2026

Alaa requested a fresher, simpler, smoother interface while retaining cream and
dark green. This is a refinement of the existing application, preserving content,
routes, forms and backend behavior. Operate mode: the primary task stays obvious.

- Cream canvas, forest-green public heading surfaces, pale mint selection and
  off-white form surfaces. Local Cairo stays the shared English/Arabic typeface.
- Public search pairs a prominent heading with a decorative capsule symbol and
  a raised search form. No stock claims, sample results or unimplemented controls
  were added. Directory and pharmacy cards use the same visual language.
- Shared stroke icons distinguish navigation destinations. Sidebar navigation is
  quieter, left/right aligned with the selected language, with a mint active state.
- Larger staff headings, clearer table headers, 44px minimum staff button targets,
  consistent status labels, and more comfortable login and profile forms.
- A single 420ms arrival animation and short control feedback provide motion;
  reduced-motion users receive neither animation nor transitions.
- The refinement stylesheet is imported after base styles. It owns these visual
  decisions; feature styles continue to own their functional layouts.

Verification: seven pages at 320/390/768/1024/1440 pixels in both languages, local
fonts, no horizontal overflow, menu/Escape/focus, retained medicine drafts during
language switching, and reduced motion. Real isolated pharmacist authentication,
dashboard and profile were checked; owner/inventory form regressions used their
existing development fixtures. Impeccable's detector returned no findings.
Typecheck, production build, smoke, 435 API tests and 14 frontend tests passed.
Screenshots and detailed scope are in `output/refresh/visual-checks.json`.

At this 6 November checkpoint, dark mode and public-stock persistence were still pending. See the 7 November integration update below for the current state; owner administration remains pending.

## Public welcome page - 6 November 2026

At Alaa's request, `/` now introduces SmartShelf with a primary medicine-search
link, a pharmacy-directory row and a staff-sign-in section. Medicine search moved
to `/search`. Brand and Home navigation return to `/`; the not-found recovery
link targets `/search`. Existing role redirects and session guards stay in place.

The welcome page reuses the cream/forest palette, mint action, local Cairo font,
stroke icons, capsule symbol and reduced-motion behavior. English/Arabic copy
uses the shared provider. Four public navigation destinations wrap onto a separate
row on tablet widths to avoid overflow.

Browser verification covers destination links, keyboard submission, search queries,
browser Back, brand/Home navigation, 404 recovery, protected routes, both languages
and 320/390/768/1024/1440 layouts. Public success responses in this check were
controlled test data; the pending public stock adapter is not implemented by this
page. Evidence is in `output/home/browser-checks.json`.

Home motion: one brief arrival draws the capsule outline while it rotates into
place; the small circular marker follows the surrounding ring and settles within
1400ms. The heading reveals over 650ms and supporting copy follows by 80ms. All
three destination links use arrows that move toward their destination on hover
or keyboard focus, mirrored in Arabic. No motion loops and no new library is
required. Reduced motion keeps the complete static artwork and directional arrows,
without entrance animations or spatial feedback. Verification evidence is recorded
in `output/home/motion-checks.json`.

## Connected display preferences - 7 November 2026

Hamid's theme foundation is connected through ThemeProvider and ThemeControl. Light retains cream/forest; Dark uses the original dark-green canvas (`#0F1C18`), panels (`#16261F`), sidebar (`#193F34`) and mint actions. The palette experiments were reverted at Alaa's request; sidebar and switch behavior are preserved. Status surfaces retain their semantic colors. System is the default and follows live device changes until a manual choice is saved independently of language. The inline head script applies the theme before the app module executes. A mandatory test guards its presence and order.

Workspace preference switches live at the bottom of the sidebar. The collapsed rail shows compact language and sun/moon buttons with accessible labels and titles; phones keep both switches inside the sidebar above the page content. Public pages retain their header controls. Shared tokens cover home, search, directory, login, owner/inventory and pharmacist pages, with EN/AR direction intact. Theme/language changes preserve form drafts and the in-memory signed-in session. No theme-change animation or new animation dependency is introduced.

On 8 November the controls were simplified to direct switches: English/العربية and sun/moon, with a sliding selected background. Theme follows the device until a saved or manually selected Light/Dark preference is present; System is no longer a choice in the control. Both switches support Tab, Enter/Space, saved preferences and reduced motion.

The desktop sidebar toggles between a 248px column and an 88px column (72px visible rail plus outer spacing), using a 300ms grid transition. Icons, active state, accessible link names, native title tooltips and sign-out remain available while collapsed. Arabic mirrors the rail; phones retain the existing Menu navigation instead of losing content width. Reduced motion removes the layout transition. Signed-in pharmacist search retains the sidebar; Home, Pharmacies and the promotional sidebar message are omitted from pharmacist workspaces. Browser checks cover real sign-in, navigation while collapsed, interrupted/repeated toggles, both themes/languages, keyboard operation and 320/390/768/1024/1440px widths.

Browser evidence in `output/theme/browser-checks.json` covers persistence, System changes, blocked storage, first paint, keyboard/focus, draft/session preservation, rendered text contrast and EN/AR responsive layouts. Owner/account/subscription and stock-form cases use development previews; public search and pharmacist reads use an isolated PostgreSQL database. Real owner onboarding and physical-device/team rehearsal remain pending. Hamid's persisted public stock adapter is now merged.


## Parchment, botanical green and saffron — 10 November 2026

This update supersedes earlier palette and typography choices above. Alaa requested
the supplied SmartShelf reference's warm parchment canvas, cream-white surfaces,
deep botanical navigation and restrained saffron selection/action highlights.
Existing routes, role permissions, forms, language providers and theme behavior remain.

- `visual-language.css` owns current light/dark semantic colors and maps them to
  Tailwind v4 theme utilities via the Vite plugin. Preflight is omitted to preserve
  existing form/dialog behavior. Existing feature styles still own layout.
- Local font packages supply Plus Jakarta Sans for Latin, Noto Kufi Arabic for
  Arabic, and IBM Plex Mono for codes, dates and numeric values. Arabic remains
  conditional on the language preference, with logical spacing and RTL preserved.
- Shared InterfaceIcon/CareSymbol wrappers now use Lucide React. The shared API
  remains stable for feature components.
- Warm borders, 16px panel corners and subtle green-tinted shadows separate
  surfaces. Saffron identifies active navigation and welcome-page actions;
  semantic error/warning/success indicators retain their meanings.
- Dark mode pairs warm charcoal surfaces with the botanical navigation. Reduced
  motion disables entrance/transition effects. No promotional sidebar card returns.
