# Independent laptop startup check

**Status: not performed.** This sheet must be completed by another team member on their own laptop. Alaa's isolated database checks do not satisfy this gate.

Use [LOCAL-SETUP.md](LOCAL-SETUP.md) and the README as the actual setup instructions. Preserve any existing local configuration and use a separate demo database. Do not share or commit `.env` files or database credentials.

Record error messages with passwords/tokens/connection strings removed. Include the fix or assigned owner for any failed step. Shiam's owner backend is merged: test real owner onboarding/subscriptions. At `/search`, choose Use live search for real database acceptance; default demo results are fictional. `/pharmacies` is the published Salamiyah roster, separate from the backend's registered-pharmacy directory API. Stop the development servers after the check.
