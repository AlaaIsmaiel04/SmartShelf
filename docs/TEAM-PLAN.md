# Two-week team plan - members build the features

Day 1 starts when the reviewed foundation is shared. These are relative days, not an instructor deadline. Confirm working hours together. Days 7/14 are review/buffer days; move them to fit availability.

## Responsibilities

| Member   | Main focus                        | Builds from scratch                                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mustafa  | Backend                           | Schema/migrations/seed, Prisma integration, JWT/guards, medicines/batches API     |
| Shiam    | Focused backend                   | Owner pharmacies/accounts, subscriptions and effective-status helper              |
| Hamid    | Mostly backend, tiny frontend     | Profile/duty/public APIs; theme/language controls after CORE                      |
| Mohammad | ~60% backend / ~40% frontend      | Shared indicator/value calculations, dashboard API, dashboard/profile/duty UI     |
| Yousef   | Simpler frontend                  | Citizen search/directory pages and public pharmacy cards                          |
| Alaa     | Remaining frontend + coordination | Shared routing/layout/styles/components, sign-in, owner/inventory UI, integration |

This is the original assignment plan. The foundation-only stage is complete: product screens, APIs, schema, authentication, calculations and tests are now implemented and integrated. See ALAA-PROGRESS.md and FINAL-REVIEW.md for current status; the individual guides retain the original responsibilities.

## Reduce dependencies

1. Day 1: agree database fields, route names, request/response shapes and shared function signatures. The API proposal is documentation, not prewritten code. The team authors wire types in packages/contracts.
2. Frontend members create small local fixtures themselves while backend endpoints are in progress. Use them only for development; final acceptance uses real persisted data.
3. Backend members test services/functions with their own fake inputs and explicit test dates rather than waiting for completed controllers or sign-in.
4. Keep changes in owned folders. Mustafa authors database migrations; Alaa coordinates shared frontend/types/root configuration changes. Review before changing shared files.
5. Small PRs and daily integration. Full independence is impossible for a shared application; make the few shared interfaces predictable rather than duplicating authentication/calculations.

## Milestones

| When      | Result                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1     | Foundation PR merged; ownership and proposed interfaces agreed; members start their own implementations             |
| Day 2     | Mohammad's first calculation helper PR; Shiam's first subscription helper PR; Mustafa's schema/Prisma foundation PR |
| Day 2-3   | Mustafa shares auth/guard implementation and usage; other API owners integrate it                                   |
| Day 5     | API owners share example payloads; frontend owners already have their own working layouts/fixtures                  |
| Day 6-7   | Week 1 API and UI PRs reviewed; initial seed and error cases available                                              |
| Day 8     | First complete real-API integration; identify remaining gaps                                                        |
| Day 10    | Owner -> stock -> dashboard -> citizen flow works against PostgreSQL                                                |
| Day 12    | CORE acceptance and startup on another member's laptop                                                              |
| Day 13-14 | Fixes, English rehearsal, every member speaks; final buffer                                                         |

## Definition of done

- Contributor implemented and can explain their assigned feature.
- Backend: validated bodies/queries/IDs, role/ownership/subscription enforcement, clear errors, public allowlist, Swagger and meaningful tests.
- Frontend: member-authored screens and requests with loading/empty/error/success and validation feedback; no developer-only notes in the final product.
- Integrated behavior uses real API/database data, with no fallback hiding API failures.
- Typecheck/build/startup checks pass; tests are added for implemented rules.
- No .env, node_modules, dist, temporary data or unreviewed schema/dependency changes in commits.

## Scope

Follow the final teacher specification and ACCEPTANCE.md. CORE first. Hamid's small light/dark and Arabic/English task follows backend CORE; Arabic/RTL is optional in instructor scope. No deployment, payments, citizen accounts, orders/reservations, maps or notifications. Defer optional FEFO/history/dispensing/configurable-expiry challenges.

Each guide in docs/tasks assigns all 14 days, handoffs, owned folders, acceptance checks and an English presentation segment. A daily short check-in covers completed work, next result and blockers. Alaa reviews PRs; the assigned contributor keeps responsibility for their own code and fixes.
