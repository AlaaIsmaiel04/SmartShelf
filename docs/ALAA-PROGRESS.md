# Current product update — 14 November 2026

This section supersedes older implementation and dependency statements below. All six members' core feature areas are integrated; no backend handoff is currently blocking Alaa.

- Medicine creation includes the first batch in one database transaction. Scientific name is optional. The reorder-threshold input is removed; new medicines use zero and edits preserve an existing threshold. Later batches still have their own form. Localized day/month/year selectors accept valid past expiry dates for waste tracking.
- Public service area is Syria / Hama / Salamiyah. `/pharmacies` shows the supplied published roster for 14–27 November 2026, with names, addresses, dates and noon/evening labels. Exact duty hours were not supplied; the page does not infer current on-duty status from these labels.
- `/search` opens with clearly labeled fictional demo medicines/pharmacies. The explicit live-search button uses persisted stock and subscription rules. The fictional results and published duty roster are separate from registered pharmacy accounts and stock.
- The compact interface supports EN/AR, RTL, light/dark buttons, responsive workspace drawers and the current parchment/green/saffron design.
- Latest review and evidence: [FINAL-REVIEW.md](FINAL-REVIEW.md). Older reports remain evidence for their recorded code/data, not proof that later public UI changes were present then.

Remaining: independent laptop setup, actual team acceptance, Day 13 scope freeze/English rehearsal, and Day 14 final demo-data/date/setup review and each member's participation. Prepared scripts do not complete these human checks.

# Integration checkpoint — 10 November 2026

This update supersedes all dependency statements in the historical checkpoints below. Shiam's owner backend and search/acceptance fixes are merged, alongside Mustafa's authentication/inventory, Mohammad's dashboard/profile integration and Hamid's duty/public APIs. Baseline: merged main `92fd554`, plus the uncommitted Day 8–9 integration follow-up.

## Day 8–9 completion

- The existing owner screens now run against Shiam's real JWT/Prisma endpoints. No feature API is replaced by sample data.
- Replaced the owner's duplicate HTTP handler with the shared API client. A real resource 404 now preserves its server reason instead of claiming the owner API is unavailable. Validation arrays, 403/409 reasons, 401 invalidation, 204 deletes, cancellation and network failures have regression coverage.
- Real browser flow: owner creates pharmacy/account/subscription; the new pharmacist signs in, creates/edits medicine and batch, and sees the dashboard and public availability update.
- Suspension, reactivation, future/expired dates, delete cancellation, confirmed deletion and subscription recreation are verified. Pharmacist inventory refreshes on focus without re-login; the backend rejects inactive writes. Deleted subscriptions preserve pharmacy/account/stock/duty records.
- Owner filters, Arabic/mobile forms, password clearing and real server 401-to-sign-in behavior were checked. Only the final request's Authorization header was deliberately invalidated for the 401 scenario; normal business responses were real.
- See [Days 8–9 verification](DAY-8-9-VERIFICATION.md) and [Day 12 acceptance](DAY-12-ACCEPTANCE.md). Evidence is in `output/day8-9/`.

Current automated checks: typecheck/build, 489 API unit tests, 28 frontend tests, 48 isolated PostgreSQL tests, 61 additional API checks and the real browser workflow. PostgreSQL client regeneration was blocked by a running API's Windows DLL lock; acceptance used the already-generated matching client and a fresh isolated migration. No working database/configuration was changed.

Yousef's frontend and Hamid's theme/public-stock dependencies are integrated. Shiam is no longer a blocker. Team rehearsal, another laptop and individual presentation participation cannot be marked complete by automated checks.

# Historical implementation and integration checkpoints

Updated 4 November 2026. Scope: the current local `alaa` checkout. The existing shell, sign-in, owner and inventory screens now use the saved Figma design, adapted to English. See `DESIGN.md` for reusable styling and scope. Real backend integration remains pending.

## What changed in this work

- Medicine creation/editing: display/scientific names, category and reorder threshold.
- Batch creation/editing: quantity, expiry and storage; number/cost/barcode are read-only on edit and excluded from PATCH at runtime.
- Historical expiry dates and zero stock are accepted; form values stay after failed saves. An inactive subscription disables changes; a server 403 preserves the rejection reason and triggers a fresh inventory read.
- Successful writes refetch inventory without reloading the page. A success notice remains if the subsequent read fails. Existing filters remain applied, so a changed medicine may leave the current result set.
- Development inventory preview now supports changes in memory, with a fixed 3 November 2026 date and no sign-in/database requests. Refresh resets all sample changes. Real routes never fall back to these fixtures.
- Stable sign-out/session-invalidating callbacks, stale-login cancellation, sign-in-required notice, and periodic/focus `/auth/me` checks. Tokens remain in memory; page reload signs out. A failed network check does not silently replace a session with sample data.
- Frontend tests cover batch PATCH privacy, creation endpoints, zero/historical input, invalid dates/numbers, server validation, 401/403/404 and network failures.

## Team handoffs

1. Mustafa: merge models/migrations/seed, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`, guards, inventory endpoints and atomic timestamp changes. Verify invalid/expired tokens, cross-pharmacy requests and inactive writes.
2. Shiam: merge owner onboarding and subscriptions. Verify ACTIVE/EXPIRED/SUSPENDED/NONE, duplicates and subscription deletion retaining stock/accounts/duty.
3. Mohammad: dashboard/profile/duty integration is merged through PR #8. Dashboard consumes `useInventoryRevision()`, fetches on navigation and focus, and displays server-calculated metrics. Day 10 real inventory writes and browser verification are complete; see `DAY-10-VERIFICATION.md`.
4. Hamid: profile, duty-period validation/overlap protection, public directory/search, Swagger and integration guides are merged through PR #10 (`69544ea`). Replace temporary authentication/persistence/subscription adapters with shared implementations when available. Alaa took over the Day 11 language foundation; dark theme and real database integration remain pending. Share component exports and shell requirements before editing shared files.
5. Yousef: share public search/directory components and route exports. Verify 390 px layout, keyboard navigation, labels, helpful empty state and phone links using real public data. Alaa integrates the existing `/` and `/pharmacies` routes when these exports exist.

No teammate-owned feature, migration, mock authentication or backend rule was implemented as a substitute for a missing dependency.

## Verification limits

After Hamid's merge, `npm test` passes 418 API tests and five frontend request/validation tests. API tests use test actors and stores; the running profile endpoints still reject authentication through a temporary guard. Passing these tests or a fixture preview does not prove real JWT, PostgreSQL persistence or CORE integration.

On 4 November 2026, the Day 6 inventory forms were checked in the browser with the in-memory development service. Checks cover all four forms, required/whitespace/fractional input, duplicate conflicts, draft preservation, save/cancel, pending controls, 400/403/404/network rejections, refresh failure/retry, retained filters, inactive subscriptions, 390 px layouts and keyboard navigation. Evidence is in `output/day6/browser-checks.json` and the two PNGs beside it. These checks supersede the earlier browser approval timeouts for Day 6.

The combined checkout was checked again after merging Hamid's work. Owner/account/subscription flows, inventory filters and all four stock forms passed browser checks. Session checks verified protected-route notices, focus-triggered `/auth/me` requests, transient network errors, 401 expiry feedback, refreshed role navigation and logout with simulated responses. The API started successfully, served Swagger, and registered profile GET/PATCH routes that returned the expected 401 through the temporary authentication guard. The one-minute session timer and real backend integration remain separate verification items.

Fixed the permanent “refreshing” success copy, distinguished temporary access verification from an inactive subscription, and restored focus during layout commit so a delayed callback cannot interfere with the next action.

The combined checkout passes typecheck, the production build, 418 API tests, five frontend request/validation tests, and foundation smoke checks. Real PostgreSQL integration and backend authorization remain unverified. Repository-wide formatting has existing failures outside this change.

Before marking Days 8â€“14 complete, run `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` against the real PostgreSQL data, attach actual results, run the latest browser checks, and complete the team rehearsal. Do not mark future days complete merely because their checklist or demo script is prepared.

## Figma styling adaptation

The saved exports were used with Alaa's explicit approval after the live connector hit its rate limit. Existing English text and functionality were retained. New shared navigation, local Cairo fonts, cream/green/gold tokens, desktop list columns, mobile cards and owner/inventory/sign-in form styling are implemented. No teammate-owned feature or mock production authentication was added.

Responsive checks cover five routes at 320, 390, 768, 1280 and 1440 pixels, local font loading, no horizontal overflow, mobile menu/Escape/focus, skip navigation, medicine forms and owner management forms. Owner Days 3-4, inventory Days 5-6 and session browser regressions pass with preview fixtures/simulated responses. Public data, real sign-in and persisted workflows still depend on backend integration; these styling checks do not mark future integration days complete.

## Day 11 language foundation (taken over from Hamid)

Added typed English/Arabic shared messages, LanguageProvider, persistent accessible language control, startup/document lang and direction, mirrored sidebar and isolated LTR data. Shared shell, sign-in/session text and route placeholders are translated. Owner/inventory labels, forms and feedback now translate; see `LANGUAGE.md` for the scope and Day 12 handoff. Dark mode remains separate.

Build and eight frontend tests pass. Browser checks cover reload persistence, blocked localStorage, translated sign-in failure, preserved unsaved login/inventory fields, RTL desktop/mobile layouts, menu/Escape/focus, and skip link. Existing owner, inventory and session regression checks pass after integration. These are fixture/simulated-response checks and do not replace real backend acceptance. Publishing to the shared repository is a separate step after local verification.

## Owner/inventory Arabic expansion — 5 November 2026

Translated all existing interface text in owner and inventory feature components, including form labels, status options, result counts, help text, deletion confirmation, local validation and preview controls. Error/success text re-renders in the selected language without clearing drafts or changing request payloads. Names, categories, addresses and stock data remain as entered. Unknown backend text remains visible unchanged. Added safe parameter interpolation and a regression test for mixed-language values; enum option values stay independent of translated labels.

Arabic workflow and responsive checks passed at 320/390/768/1280/1440px. Existing English owner/account/subscription, inventory and session browser checks pass. This work is delivered alongside the Figma and language-foundation changes.
