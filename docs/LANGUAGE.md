# English / Arabic interface

Alaa took over Hamid's Day 11 task at the user's request on 4 November 2026. The language foundation was built independently; Mustafa's and Shiam's APIs are now merged and real owner-to-stock workflows are verified. The Figma styling and language changes are delivered together.

## Implemented

- Direct English/العربية button switch in the public header and workspace sidebar, with a sliding selected background and localized action label. Tab and Enter/Space work without opening a dropdown.
- Persistent English/Arabic preference, safe fallback to English if browser storage is unavailable or contains an invalid value.
- Typed translation keys with English defaults and Arabic copy for navigation, shared shell/footer, sign-in, known sign-in/session messages, existing route placeholders, and the owner/inventory screens and forms.
- Document `lang` and `dir` set on startup and updated before paint on selection. Arabic mirrors the workspace sidebar and direction-aware grids; English restores the original layout.
- Automatic text direction for medicine/scientific names and batch/barcode entry; identifiers, phone numbers, credentials and wire-format dates/costs retain appropriate LTR treatment. Data is neither translated nor reformatted for API submission.
- Language changes preserve unsaved login/inventory fields. No authentication, role, subscription or API fallback behavior was changed.

## Extend the dictionary

Import `useLanguage` from `features/preferences/LanguageProvider`. Add a literal English key and its Arabic translation to `locales/messages.ts` or `locales/feature-messages.ts`, then render `t('Your message')`. TypeScript catches missing keys. Keep compound sentences together rather than assembling fragments with incompatible Arabic word order. Use complete parameterized messages for counts and sentences containing user data. Arabic counts use a neutral count label; English retains singular/plural wording. Parameter values are isolated for bidirectional text and are never interpreted as HTML.

Use `translateMessage` only for known application messages; unknown server details intentionally remain unchanged. Do not translate user-entered values or drug names. Keep form labels in the selected language while using `dir="ltr"` for identifiers. Use logical CSS properties and direction-aware layouts; do not reverse strings or change stored dates.

## Remaining scope

Owner/inventory labels, forms, help text, statuses, counts, confirmation dialogs, local validation, success feedback and development-preview controls now translate on selection. Messages stored in component state stay in their canonical form so they also translate when the language changes after an error or successful save. Dynamic pharmacy/account success messages store a key and parameters instead of a sentence in the previous language.

User-entered values, pharmacy names/addresses, medicine names/categories and batch data stay exactly as supplied. Unknown server error details remain visible in their original language; a translation cannot safely be invented for an arbitrary backend message. Native browser validation messages follow the browser's own language. Dashboard/profile/duty screens now translate labels, validation and feedback through pharmacist-messages.ts, preserving drafts. Their real API browser flows and RTL layouts passed at 320/390/768/1440px. Public search/directory also use the shared language provider. Hamid's theme provider is integrated. Current light/dark buttons sit in the public header and workspace sidebar; System remains a provider preference. Scientific name is optional and expiry uses translated day/month/year selectors.

## Checks

Eight frontend tests pass, including dictionary/fallback/storage cases. Browser checks cover persisted selection after reload, translated sign-in errors, preserved drafts, blocked storage, LTR fields, a right-hand desktop sidebar, mobile menu/Escape/focus and skip navigation. Arabic login, public placeholders, owner and inventory layouts were checked at 320/390/768/1440px without horizontal overflow. Functional owner/inventory/session regression checks use development fixtures or simulated API responses; real backend acceptance remains pending.

On 5 November 2026, Arabic owner/inventory workflows passed browser checks: search/filter/clear, pharmacy and account creation, date validation, subscription save/suspend/reactivate/delete/cancel, medicine/batch creation and editing, read-only fields, inactive write restrictions, validation feedback, and success/error retranslation after switching. Values and drafts were preserved. Arabic layouts passed at 320/390/768/1280/1440px; the existing English owner/inventory/session regressions also passed. Preview samples and simulated API responses are development evidence, not persisted acceptance results.

## Current preferences integration - 7 November 2026

The earlier check counts above describe the original language rollout. The current app has 23 passing frontend tests, including language fallback/interpolation and theme storage/system behavior. `ThemeProvider` sits inside `LanguageProvider`; `theme.css` loads after the shared styling, and the inline boot script restores the theme before React loads.

The current headers use direct sun/moon and English/العربية switches. Theme follows the device by default until a Light/Dark preference is saved; there is no longer a System dropdown choice. Theme changes preserve unsaved forms and the in-memory sign-in session. Saved theme and language are independent. Blocked storage leaves both controls usable with safe fallbacks. The original integration checks cover EN/AR, both themes, keyboard controls, first-paint theme, draft/session preservation and 320/390/768/1024/1440 layouts. Evidence: `output/theme/browser-checks.json`. Owner form evidence uses previews; public/pharmacist reads use a separate real database. Real owner integration is complete. Independent laptop and team rehearsal remain pending; see FINAL-REVIEW.md.
